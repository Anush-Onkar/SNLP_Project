' however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed 'tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair
as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes
' later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound
that's different from what i used to say when i was a child' said the gryphon
well i never heard it beforesaid the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense
' alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again
i should like to have it explainedsaid the mock turtle
she can't explain itsaid the gryphon hastily
go on with the next verse
' but about his toesthe mock turtle persisted
how could he turn them out with his nose you know' it's the first position in dancing
alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject
go on with the next versethe gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden
' alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie' later editions continued as follows the panther took pie-crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat
when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuffthe mock turtle interrupted if you don't explain it as you go on it's by far the most confusing thing i ever heard' yes i think you'd better leave offsaid the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so
shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrillethe gryphon went on
or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song' oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind' alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her turtle soup will you old fellow' the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup beautiful soup who cares for fish game or any other dish who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup' chorus againcried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial's beginning' was heard in the distance
come oncried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song
what trial is italice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come onand ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup' who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other
in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish they'd get the trial done' she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time
alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there
that's the judgeshe said to herself because of his great wig
' the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming
and that's the jury-boxthought alice and those twelve creaturesshe was obliged to say creaturesyou see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors
she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all
however jury-menwould have done just as well
the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon
they can't have anything to put down yet before the trial's begun
' they're putting down their namesthe gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
' stupid thingsalice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the courtand the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking
alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things' on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell stupidand that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
a nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's overthought alice
one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked
this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away
she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
herald read the accusationsaid the king
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away' consider your verdictthe king said to the jury
not yet not yetthe rabbit hastily interrupted
there's a great deal to come before that' call the first witnesssaid the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness' the first witness was the hatter
he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other
i beg pardon your majestyhe began for bringing these in but i hadn't quite finished my tea when i was sent for
' you ought to have finishedsaid the king
when did you begin' the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm-in-arm with the dormouse
fourteenth of march i think it washe said
fifteenthsaid the march hare
sixteenthadded the dormouse
write that downthe king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
take off your hatthe king said to the hatter
it isn't minesaid the hatter
stolenthe king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact
i keep them to sellthe hatter added as an explanation i've none of my own
i'm a hatter
' here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted
give your evidencesaid the king and don't be nervous or i'll have you executed on the spot
' this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her
i wish you wouldn't squeeze so
said the dormouse who was sitting next to her
i can hardly breathe
' i can't help itsaid alice very meekly i'm growing
' you've no right to grow heresaid the dormouse
don't talk nonsensesaid alice more boldly you know you're growing too
' yes but i grow at a reasonable pacesaid the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion
and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concerton which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off
give your evidencethe king repeated angrily or i'll have you executed whether you're nervous or not
' i'm a poor man your majestythe hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadn't begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the bread-and-butter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea' the twinkling of the whatsaid the king
it began with the teathe hatter replied
of course twinkling begins with a tsaid the king sharply
do you take me for a dunce go on' i'm a poor manthe hatter went on and most things twinkled after thatonly the march hare said' i didn'tthe march hare interrupted in a great hurry
you didsaid the hatter
i deny itsaid the march hare
he denies itsaid the king leave out that part
' well at any rate the dormouse saidthe hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep
after thatcontinued the hatter i cut some more bread- and-butter' but what did the dormouse sayone of the jury asked
that i can't remembersaid the hatter
you must rememberremarked the king or i'll have you executed
' the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter and went down on one knee
i'm a poor man your majestyhe began
you're a very poor speakersaid the king
here one of the guinea-pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done
they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea-pig head first and then sat upon it
i'm glad i've seen that donethought alice
i've so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now
' if that's all you know about it you may stand down' continued the king
i can't go no lowersaid the hatter i'm on the floor as it is
' then you may sit downthe king replied
here the other guinea-pig cheered and was suppressed
come that finished the guinea-pigsthought alice
now we shall get on better
' i'd rather finish my teasaid the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers
you may gosaid the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on
and just take his head off outsidethe queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door
call the next witnesssaid the king
the next witness was the duchess's cook
she carried the pepper-box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once
give your evidencesaid the king
shan'tsaid the cook
the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross-examine this witness
' well if i must i mustthe king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of' pepper mostlysaid the cook
treaclesaid a sleepy voice behind her
collar that dormousethe queen shrieked out
behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his whiskers' for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared
never mindsaid the king with an air of great relief
call the next witness
and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross-examine the next witness
it quite makes my forehead ache' alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they haven't got much evidence yetshe said to herself
imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice' alice's evidence herecried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before
oh i beg your pardonshe exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box or they would die
the trial cannot proceedsaid the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places allhe repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said do
alice looked at the jury-box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move
she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies muchshe said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
' as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court
what do you know about this businessthe king said to alice
nothingsaid alice
nothing whateverpersisted the king
nothing whateversaid alice
that's very importantthe king said turning to the jury
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of coursehe said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke
unimportant of course i meantthe king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportant unimportantimportantas if he were trying which word sounded best
some of the jury wrote it down importantand some unimportant
alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn't matter a bitshe thought to herself
at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book cackled out silenceand read out from his book rule forty-two
all persons more than a mile high to leave the court
' everybody looked at alice
i'm not a mile highsaid alice
you aresaid the king
nearly two miles highadded the queen
well i shan't go at any ratesaid alice besides that's not a regular rule you invented it just now
' it's the oldest rule in the booksaid the king
then it ought to be number onesaid alice
the king turned pale and shut his note-book hastily
consider your verdicthe said to the jury in a low trembling voice
there's more evidence to come yet please your majestysaid the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up
' what's in itsaid the queen
i haven't opened it yetsaid the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody
' it must have been thatsaid the king unless it was written to nobody which isn't usual you know
' who is it directed tosaid one of the jurymen
it isn't directed at allsaid the white rabbit in fact there's nothing written on the outside
he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn't a letter after all it's a set of verses
' are they in the prisoner's handwritingasked another of the jurymen
no they're notsaid the white rabbit and that's the queerest thing about it
the jury all looked puzzled
he must have imitated somebody else's handsaid the king
the jury all brightened up again
please your majestysaid the knave i didn't write it and they can't prove i did there's no name signed at the end
' if you didn't sign itsaid the king that only makes the matter worse
you must have meant some mischief or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man
' there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day
that proves his guiltsaid the queen
it proves nothing of the sortsaid alice
why you don't even know what they're about' read themsaid the king
the white rabbit put on his spectacles
where shall i begin please your majestyhe asked
begin at the beginningthe king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop
' these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim
he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were
my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it
don't let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me
' that's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet' said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury' if any one of them can explain itsaid alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him i'll give him sixpence
i don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it
' the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in itbut none of them attempted to explain the paper
if there's no meaning in itsaid the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we needn't try to find any
and yet i don't knowhe went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all
said i could not swim you can't swim can youhe added turning to the knave
the knave shook his head sadly
do i look like ithe said
which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard
all right so farsaid the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true that's the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know' but it goes on they all returned from him to yousaid alice
why there they aresaid the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table
nothing can be clearer than that
then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear i thinkhe said to the queen
neversaid the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke
the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted
then the words don't fit yousaid the king looking round the court with a smile
there was a dead silence
it's a punthe king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdictthe king said for about the twentieth time that day
no nosaid the queen
sentence firstverdict afterwards
' stuff and nonsensesaid alice loudly
the idea of having the sentence first' hold your tonguesaid the queen turning purple
i won'tsaid alice
off with her headthe queen shouted at the top of her voice
nobody moved
who cares for yousaid alice she had grown to her full size by this time
you're nothing but a pack of cards' at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face
wake up alice dearsaid her sister why what a long sleep you've had' oh i've had such a curious dreamsaid alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it's getting late
so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream
the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pig-baby was sneezing on the duchess's knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard's slate-pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle
so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- bells and the queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle's heavy sobs
lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after-time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child-life and the happy summer days
the end
